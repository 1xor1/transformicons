Local installation is dead simple. We use all local files and directories to run this project. This ensures you the developer don't need to  install anythign directly or globally to your system. Also take note we use libsass for preprocessing all of our Sass code.

$ npm install
```

**Start a server and watch Sass files**

```bash
$ npm start
